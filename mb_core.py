"""
MovieBox — a Stremio addon for a wefeed-based streaming platform.

STRICT ZERO-BANDWIDTH RULE (v1.9.0, user directive)
    NOTHING but tiny JSON is served from here — no playlists, no
    manifests, no subtitles, no media. Cards point DIRECTLY at the
    platform's CDN: the DASH MPD carries a CloudFront signed COOKIE via
    proxyHeaders (the cookie is not IP-bound — verified cross-IP), and
    subtitles use the caption CDN's open direct URLs. The old
    synthesized /hls, /dash and /sub routes were removed.

SECTIONS
    1. config            constants, branding, hosts
    2. utilities         TTL caches, formatting helpers
    3. platform api      token bootstrap + signed mobile api_call + search
    4. metadata          cinemeta / imdb / tmdb title matching
    5. catalogs          scraped pools -> catalog & search metas
    6. cdn / dash        CloudFront cookie parsing, MPD parsing (quality
                         labels + prewarm verification)
    7. cards             strict-zero direct-CDN stream cards
    8. subtitles         mobile caption endpoint + web fallback (direct URLs)
    9. stream cards      per-dub card building, caching, pre-warming
   10. landing page      install / usage html
   11. http server       routes, gzip, CORS, cache headers
   12. keep-alive        anti-sleep pinger

# shared, volume-flagged one. Absent/empty (default) = direct connections,
